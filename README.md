This is all my code for scraping, plotting, and analysing property data.

Scraped data is included in the repository, this comprises only publicly available data
and does not contain any data requiring a subscription to the relevant data sources.

Code was made for my own use but I'm sharing it because why not. Accordingly, no
instructions are provided and the code is not structured to centralise configuration or
be user-friendly or anything. Feel free to ask me questions about it, though.
